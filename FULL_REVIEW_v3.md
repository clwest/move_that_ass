FULL_REVIEW_v3.md
Executive Summary
MoveYourAzz combines a Django 5 backend with a Flutter 3 client to deliver a meme‑driven wellness app. Registration and login work via dj_rest_auth; tokens persist across sessions. Celery workers now process long AI tasks—meme generation, workout plans, voice journal transcription, and image identification—returning task IDs for polling. The TodayPage loads the user profile and goals, then displays herd activities and badges. CI uses GitHub Actions to run tests and flake8, and the badge in the README shows passing status. Key improvements since the last audit include token persistence, Celery integration, and herd feed pagination. Remaining concerns are open CORS, a public Celery health endpoint, and potential N+1 queries in the dashboard feed. Overall, the stack is functional but needs security tightening and performance tuning before production.

Working Endpoints

Endpoints are registered in backend/server/urls.py.

Security Checklist
CSRF – Middleware enabled by default.

CORS – CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True; should be restricted for production.

Throttling – DRF anon/user throttles (20/min and 100/min).

Permissions – Global IsAuthenticated, but celery_ping uses AllowAny.

Headers – No custom security headers (e.g., HSTS) configured.

Performance Notes
dashboard_feed merges multiple querysets and sorts in Python, which may cause high SQL counts on large datasets.

Celery tasks queue via Redis with retry logic, but no monitoring dashboard is configured. Tasks defined in core.tasks and voice_journals.tasks.

Image uploads in vision have no explicit size limit; only rate limiting is enforced. 

Developer Experience & CI
Tests exist across apps (35 files), but running make test-backend fails if the virtual environment is missing. 

Flutter widget tests are skipped when the SDK isn’t installed. 

Flake8 is invoked in CI and locally through make lint-backend. 

README instructs setting up .env, running migrations, and starting Celery. 

Docker deployment scripts are absent.

Remaining Issues (from ISSUES_TODO_v2.yml)
Lock down the vision endpoint. 

Clean up unused endpoints and decorators. 

Implement challenge completion and upload-voice logic. 

Restrict the celery_ping view to authenticated users. 

Address flake8 warnings and optimize dashboard_feed. 

Open Questions
Should celery_ping require authentication or be removed before production?

Are there plans to limit CORS to trusted domains?

What tooling will monitor Celery queues and worker health?

Will Docker or Compose be introduced for consistent deployments?
